Main Script
===========

The `main.py` file is the entry point of the application and is intended to be executed directly. It **should not** be imported as a module into other code. Use the following command to run the application:

.. code-block:: bash

    python main.py

It contains the `MainApp` class, which handles the setup of the Tkinter canvas and UI, but it is not designed for reusability as a module.

.. automodule:: main
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
   :show-inheritance:

.. note::
    This file should only be executed directly and is not intended to be imported as a module.
