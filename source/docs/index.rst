Virus on network documentation
==============================

This is a semester project, a recreation of the NetLogo Virus on Network model, implemented in Python. The model simulates the spread of a virus through a network of nodes. Each node can be in a susceptible, infected, or resistant state, and the simulation allows the tracking of how the virus spreads and how nodes interact with each other.
