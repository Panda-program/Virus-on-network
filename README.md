# Introduction
This document shows technical details and functionality of part of project `Virus on network`
containing the whole simulation logic from creating nodes and connections to handling the states and loop.

*Created by Timotej Vronƒç*

# Overview
The `Map` class manages overall simulation, including creation of nodes and connections between them.

`Node` class is responsible for handling all the logic for changing states, infecting other neighbours, visual representation.

`Connection` class is responsible for connection line between nodes and updating itself based on state of nodes.

`State` enum class defines various states for Nodes.


# Documentation

## `Map` class

### Attributes

#### `speed`
- **Type:** `int`
- **Description**: Controls the speed of simulation loop in miliseconds

#### `canvas`
- **Type:** `tkinter.Canvas`
- **Description**: canvas object for visuall representation of nodes and connections

#### `width`
- **Type:** `int`
- **Description**: Width of the map

#### `height`
- **Type:** `int`
- **Description**: Height of the map

#### `numberOfNodes`
- **Type:** `int`
- **Description**: Number of nodes which will be created

#### `avgNodeDegree`
- **Type:** `int`
- **Description**: Average number of connections between nodes

#### `initialOutbreakSize`
- **Type:** `int`
- **Description**: Number of infected nodes at the start 

#### `virusSpreadChance`
- **Type:** `float`
- **Description**: Chance of infecting neighbour

#### `virusCheckFreq`
- **Type:** `int`
- **Description**: Frequency - number of ticks between nodes checking if they are infected

#### `recoveryChance`
- **Type:** `float`
- **Description**: Chance of node recovering from virus

#### `gainResistChance`
- **Type:** `float`
- **Description:** Chance of node after not being able to recover to gain resistance against the virus

#### `recoveryChance`
- **Type:** `float`
- **Description**: Chance of node recovering from virus

#### `nodes[]`
- **Type:** `array[Node]`
- **Description**: list of Node objects on the map

#### `isLoaded`
- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Description**: value indicating wether the map has loaded

#### `isEnd`
- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Description**: value indicating wether the simulation has ended or not

### Methods

####  `__init__(self, canvas, speed, numberOfNodes, avgNodeDegree, initialOutbreakSize, virusSpreadChance, virusCheckFreq, recoveryChance, gainResistChance)`
**Description:** Constructor of the map setting the initial attributes and state of the map

#### `setup(self)`
**Description:**
- Checks if the map has been loaded. If was loaded then calls reset() method.
- calls methods for creating nodes, connections and infecting first nodes
- Performs one tick and check for the nodes and connections to display properly and update their starting state
- sets `isLoaded` to True and `isEnd` to False

#### `createMap(self)`
**Description:** Creates nodes based on `numberOfNodes` parameter on the map and stores them in nodes[] list where each node is assigned random position on the map.

#### `reset(self)`
**Description:** 
- sets variables `isEnd` to True and `isLoaded` to False
- calls `canvas` object to delete everything drawed on canvas
- sets `nodes[]` list to be blank (deleting all the instances of nodes)

#### `createConnections(self)`
**Description:*
- calculates total number of connections to be created between nodes 
- while the number of created connections is less than total number of connections it takes one random node from the `nodes[]` list and:  
    - loops through other nodes checking if the nodes are not already sharing connection
    - checks if the selected nodes haven't reached the `avgNodeDegree`
    - calls the `getDistance()` method to calculate distance between two nodes and stores the node which is closest
    - when found closest node it creates the connection between the nodes

#### `infectNodes(self)`
**Description:**
