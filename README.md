# Introduction
This document shows technical details and functionality of part of project `Virus on network`
containing the whole simulation logic from creating nodes and connections to handling the states and loop.

*Created by Timotej Vronƒç*

# Overview
The `Map` class manages overall simulation, including creation of nodes and connections between them.

`Node` class is responsible for handling all the logic for changing states, infecting other neighbours, visual representation.

`Connection` class is responsible for connection line between nodes and updating itself based on state of nodes.

`State` enum class defines various states for Nodes.

# Classes

## Map class
### Attributes

#### `speed`
- **Type:** `int`
- **Description**: Controls the speed of simulation loop in miliseconds

#### `canvas`
- **Type:** `tkinter.Canvas`
- **Description**: canvas object for visuall representation of nodes and connections

#### `width`
- **Type:** `int`
- **Description**: Width of the map

#### `height`
- **Type:** `int`
- **Description**: Height of the map

#### `numberOfNodes`
- **Type:** `int`
- **Description**: Number of nodes which will be created

#### `avgNodeDegree`
- **Type:** `int`
- **Description**: Average number of connections between nodes

#### `initialOutbreakSize`
- **Type:** `int`
- **Description**: Number of infected nodes at the start 

#### `virusSpreadChance`
- **Type:** `float`
- **Description**: Chance of infecting neighbour

#### `virusCheckFreq`
- **Type:** `int`
- **Description**: Frequency - number of ticks between nodes checking if they are infected

#### `recoveryChance`
- **Type:** `float`
- **Description**: Chance of node recovering from virus

#### `gainResistChance`
- **Type:** `float`
- **Description:** Chance of node after not being able to recover to gain resistance against the virus

#### `nodes[]`
- **Type:** `array[Node]`
- **Description**: list of Node objects on the map

#### `isLoaded`
- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Description**: value indicating wether the map has loaded

#### `isEnd`
- **Type:** `boolean`
- **Description**: value indicating wether the simulation has ended or not

### Methods

####  `__init__(self, canvas, speed, numberOfNodes, avgNodeDegree, initialOutbreakSize, virusSpreadChance, virusCheckFreq, recoveryChance, gainResistChance)`
Constructor of the map setting the initial attributes and state of the map

#### `setup(self)`
- Checks if the map has been loaded. If was loaded then calls reset() method.
- calls methods for creating nodes, connections and infecting first nodes
- Performs one tick and check for the nodes and connections to display properly and update their starting state
- sets `isLoaded` to True and `isEnd` to False

#### `createMap(self)`
Creates nodes based on `numberOfNodes` parameter on the map and stores them in nodes[] list where each node is assigned random position on the map.

#### `reset(self)`
- sets variables `isEnd` to True and `isLoaded` to False
- calls `canvas` object to delete everything drawed on canvas
- sets `nodes[]` list to be blank (deleting all the instances of nodes)

#### `createConnections(self)`
- calculates total number of connections to be created between nodes 
- while the number of created connections is less than total number of connections it takes one random node from the `nodes[]` list and:  
    - loops through other nodes checking if the nodes are not already sharing connection
    - checks if the selected nodes haven't reached the `avgNodeDegree`
    - calls the `getDistance()` method to calculate distance between two nodes and stores the node which is closest
    - when found closest node it creates the connection between the nodes

#### `getDistance(self, node1, node2)`
Calculates and returns euclidean distance between given nodes and returns their distance

#### `infectNodes(self)`
Loop where it randomly picks node which will be infected, untill the number of infected nodes equals `initialOutbreakSize` parameter

#### `tick(self)`
This recursive method is the main loop of the simulation whitch does the following:
- checks if game is at its end or if its not loaded, if it is, then it breaks the loop
- loops for every node in `nodes[]` and calls `node.tick()` method for the nodes to update their states
- loops again through every node and calls `node.check()` method for the node to calculate next `state` and checks if the node and checks if the node is infected
- checks if `isEnd` equals to True, if yes, then it breaks the simulation loop
- checks if the number of infected nodes is 0, if yes, then sets `isEnd` to True
