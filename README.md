# Virus on Network Simulation

This is a semester project, a recreation of the NetLogo Virus on Network model, implemented in Python. The model simulates the spread of a virus through a network of nodes. Each node can be in a susceptible, infected, or resistant state, and the simulation allows the tracking of how the virus spreads and how nodes interact with each other.

## Requirements

To get started, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python's package installer)

## Installation

To install the dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies using the setup.bat file:

    Simply double-click `setup.bat` to install all necessary dependencies.

    Alternatively, you can run this command manually:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
## Running the Simulation
To start the simulation, run the `start.bat` file located in the root folder. This will execute the `main.py` script located in the source folder.

Alternatively, you can run the main script manually by navigating to the source folder and running:

```bash
    python main.py
```
